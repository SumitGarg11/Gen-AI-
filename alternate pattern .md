Contextual embedding in the context of Generative AI typically refers to the representation of words 
or phrases in a text that takes into account the surrounding context. In other words,
it's a way to capture the meaning of a word based on how it's used in a particular sentence or paragraph, 
rather than relying solely on its dictionary definition.

In models like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), contextual embeddings are generated by the model's attention mechanism,
which looks at the entire input sequence to create representations for each token (word or subword).
These embeddings are then used to generate the next word in a sequence, making the model capable of generating coherent and contextually appropriate text.

The advantage of contextual embeddings is that they can capture nuances in language, such as polysemy (words with multiple meanings) 
and context-dependent meanings. This allows models like GPT to generate more human-like text compared to traditional models that 
use static word embeddings like Word2Vec or GloVe.


A) Supervised Learning:
Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on a labeled dataset,
meaning that each input data point is paired with the correct output. The goal is for the model to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs,
so that it can make predictions on new, unseen data. Common examples include classification (predicting a label) and regression 
(predicting a continuous value).

B) Unsupervised Learning:
Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on an unlabeled dataset,
meaning that the data does not have corresponding output labels. The goal is for the model to learn the underlying structure or patterns in the data.
Common examples include clustering (grouping similar data points) and dimensionality reduction (reducing the number of features while preserving 
important information).

C) Semi-supervised Learning:
Semi-supervised learning is a type of machine learning that falls between supervised and unsupervised learning. In this approach,
the model is trained on a dataset that contains both labeled and unlabeled data. The model uses the labeled data to learn patterns and 
then uses the unlabeled data to improve its understanding of the data distribution. Semi-supervised learning is useful when obtaining 
labeled data is expensive or time-consuming.

D) Reinforcement Learning:
Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment.
The agent receives feedback in the form of rewards or punishments based on its actions, 
and the goal is to learn a policy that maximizes the cumulative reward over time. Reinforcement learning is often used in 
applications such as game playing, robotics, and autonomous driving.


# Alternate Approaches Pattern

**Question:** Which of the following is NOT an alternate approach pattern in Generative AI?
- A) GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks)
- B) VAEs (Variational Autoencoders)
- C) RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks)
- D) CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks)
- **Answer:** C) RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks)

These are different types of neural networks used , each with its own characteristics and applications:

A) **GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks)**: GANs are a type of neural network architecture used in unsupervised machine learning,
particularly for generating new data instances. GANs consist of two networks, a generator and a discriminator,
which are trained simultaneously in a competitive setting. The generator creates new data instances,
while the discriminator evaluates them for authenticity. GANs are commonly used in image generation tasks.

B) **VAEs (Variational Autoencoders)**: VAEs are a type of neural network used in unsupervised learning for latent variable modeling.
VAEs are designed to learn a low-dimensional representation of input data, capturing the underlying structure or distribution of the data.
They consist of an encoder network that maps input data to a latent space and a decoder network that reconstructs the input data from the
latent space representation. VAEs are often used in applications like image generation and data compression.

C) **RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks)**: RNNs are a type of neural network architecture designed for sequence modeling tasks. 
Unlike traditional feedforward neural networks, RNNs have connections that form directed cycles, allowing them to
exhibit dynamic temporal behavior. RNNs are well-suited for tasks such as speech recognition, language modeling,
and sequence prediction, where the order of inputs is important.

D) **CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks)**: CNNs are a type of neural network architecture commonly used in image recognition 
and computer vision tasks. CNNs are designed to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features from input images. 
They consist of multiple layers of convolutional filters followed by nonlinear activation functions and pooling layers.
CNNs have been highly successful in tasks such as image classification, object detection, and image segmentation.
